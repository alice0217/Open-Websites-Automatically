# URL Opener

This GUI opens URL links with a sound effect at the time pre-set by the user. I followed Brad Traversy's Youtube tutorial. 
These are links to his Github and Youtube channel: https://github.com/bradtraversy & https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb. 

## Interface:

## How to Use it:
  1. Enter Weekday in integers from 1 to 5 to represent Monday to Friday. 
  2. Input hour in 24h form and minute in 2 digits such as, 05 or 50. 
  3. Input a URL.
  4. After four entries, click <code>Add</code> to save information in the box below. 
  5. Information can be edited and deleted in the box. If you want to edit any information, first click the line and the corresponding entries will appear in the entries again. After editing, click <code>Save Changes</code> to save all the chanegs you made. 
  6. If you want to delete the line, click the line in the box and click <code>Remove</code>. 
  7. If you want to open the web browser manually, click <code>Start</code>. 

## Reminders:
  1. The web browsers must all start with https://. for example, www.google.com won't work but https://google.com will work. 
  2. Once any information is edited, restart the APP so that all changed information can be updated to the program. Otherwise, for example, if you set a link to open at 12:13 and you didn't restart the program, the program will be unable to open the link at 12:13 unless you restart the program before 12:13. This also means, once you start the program at 12:14, the web browser scheduled to be opened at 12:13 won't be opened. 
  3. The time (hour & minute) must be consistent with the time zone of your computer.
