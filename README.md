# Web-Browser-Automatic-Open-Tool

This APP opens a certain web browser with a sound effect at a certain time pre-set by the user. I made this APP after watching Brad Traversy's Youtube tutorial, and most of my code is referenced from his open source. Links to his Github and Youtube channel: https://github.com/bradtraversy & https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb. 

## Interface:
  ![WechatIMG2056](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71456398/114523986-671e1c80-9c77-11eb-8f3e-5e763d129563.jpeg)

## Guide:
  1. Enter Weekday in 1/2/3/4/5 which represents Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday... Input hour in 24h form. Input exact minute in 2 digits for example 05 or 50. Input a link. 
  2. After four entries, click <code>Add</code> to save information in the box below. 
  3. If you want to edit any information, click the line in the box and the corresponding entries will appear in the entries again. After editing, click <code>Save Changes</code> to save all the chanegs you made. 
  4. If you want to delete the line, click the line in the box and click <code>Remove</code>. 
  5. If you want to open the web browser manually, click <code>Start</code>. 

## Reminders:
  1. The web browsers must all start with https://. for example, www.google.com won't work but https://google.com will work. 
  2. Once any information is edited, restart the APP so that all changed information can be updated to the program. Otherwise, for example, if you set a link to open at 12:13 and you didn't restart the program, the program is unable to open the link at 12:13 unless you restart the program before 12:13. This also means, once you start the program at 12:14, the web browser scheduled to be opened at 12:13 won't be opened. 
  3. The time (hour & minute) must be consistent with the time zone of your computer.
